        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b>1. <u>Spamming Calls And Emails</u></b></h2>
            <h3><p>I know that most of you get calls or emails which pretends as an authentic person of any private/government organisation,and tell you that your bank account gets deactivated and give me this info of your bank in this number/website.</p>
            <p>Some of us are not very much aware about this fraud and we give our detail to these person and later we recive a message that x amount is debited from your account</p>
            <p>Some people try to make conversation with the frauder just for making fun of him/her but the other person cleverly by social engineering leaks the detail from him/her</p>
            <p>So it is advisable to not recive such call and reply such email becuse you don't know that at what situation you leak your information.</p>
            <p>If you are trapped in this fraud then contact your bank and block your account immediatly and contact to the nearest police station's cyber cell ASAP.</p>
        </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b>2. <u> Phishing Attacks</u></b></h2>
            <h3><p>Let a person want to do any transaction from the bank online and he/she type the url of the website on the browser and mistkes the spelling, then he/she landed on a website similar to the original one
            he/she type the details of his/her bank account and as he/she click on login button then the information get stord into the server of the hacker and they are shown a blank page or a page full of adds and immediatly the got a message that xyz amount is debited from your bank account.<br>
            In this case it is advisable to don't type the url by yourself and type the website given in the bank documents and do not google the name of bank because chances are there that the first website is not original one<br>
            If you see many adds on the website which is a government website then it is definitly a fake website.</p>
        </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b>3. <u>Sim Swapping</u></b></h2>
            <h2><p>Let a person wants to do payment of a laptop in a trusted e-commerce website and he/she select net banking option and before he/she proceed to payment he/she has to submit the One Time Password (OTP) what happens if he/she will not recivee any OTP.<br>
            Also the mobile network has got lost due to which OTP and any call/message is not recived the chances are there that your sim get swapped.<br>
            This attack is performed usually to that user which port his/her number into a new number in any unauthorised way by any unauthorised person.<br>
            In this attack the hacker make a duplicate sim of your sim and tells your Internet Service Provider that he/she is the authentic user and then your service get blocked,resulting you don't get any messages.<br>
            This is a very dangerous attack since here you don't get notified about any attack in your bank account.<br>
            In this case you have to visit your branch to block your account if there is any fraud occur and inform this to police and ISP.</p>
